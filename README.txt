IT Support Ticket Resolution Time Predictor


Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data science application designed to predict the resolution time for IT support tickets in a mid-size tech company, cluster tickets by type for better resource allocation, and provide interactive dashboard reporting. It uses machine learning techniques including regression for predictions and unsupervised clustering for grouping, built with Python and common libraries. The goal is to improve operational efficiency, set realistic expectations for users, and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven insights.


Key Components:


Regression Modeling: Predicts how long a ticket will take to resolve based on features like priority, category, description, and user details.
Clustering: Groups similar tickets (e.g., by type or complexity) using algorithms like K-Means and NMF for topic modeling.
Dashboard: An interactive Streamlit app for visualizing KPIs, trends, predictions, and clusters.

This project is fully automated, with scripts for data preparation, feature engineering, model training, clustering, and dashboard launch. It supports both real datasets (e.g., from Kaggle with 5 CSV files totaling >10,000 rows) and synthetic data generation if needed.
Project Flow
The project follows a professional data science pipeline, automated via a main script:

Data Preparation (data_prep.py): Loads and merges the 5 CSV files from the data folder (or generates synthetic data if missing). Checks dataset summary (shape, info, describe), handles missing values (fill means for numerics, 'Unknown' for categoricals), filters to key columns (e.g., ticket_id, creation_timestamp, closure_timestamp, priority, category, description, user_department, resolution_time_hours), calculates resolution time if absent, and saves as data/merged_tickets.csv. Logs progress and errors to outputs/data_log.txt.
EDA & Feature Engineering (feature_engineering.py): Performs exploratory data analysis (histograms for resolution time, correlation heatmaps, value counts for categories/priorities, boxplots by priority, pairplots for key features, word clouds for descriptions). Adds features:

Time-based: hour_created, day_of_week, is_weekend, month, is_peak_hour, season (month//3).
Text-based: description_length, urgency_keywords (regex for 'urgent|critical|asap|immediate|down|crash'), TF-IDF vectors (200 features), sentiment score via spaCy.
User-based: user_avg_resolution_time, user_ticket_count (grouped by department).
Preprocesses: One-hot encodes categoricals (priority, category, user_department), scales numerics with StandardScaler, drops NaNs in target. Saves as data/cleaned_tickets.csv. Generates and saves 5+ plots (e.g., outputs/resolution_hist.png, outputs/corr_heatmap.png). Logs to outputs/eda_log.txt.


Regression Modeling (regression_model.py): Loads cleaned data, splits 80/20 (stratified by priority if imbalanced). Trains and evaluates:

Baseline: LinearRegression.
Advanced: XGBoost (learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100).
Primary: RandomForestRegressor, tuned with GridSearchCV (params: n_estimators [50,100,200], max_depth [None,10,20], min_samples_split [2,5], max_features ['sqrt','log2'], min_samples_leaf [1,2,4]).
Uses cross-validation for robustness, plots learning curves and feature importances. Metrics: RÂ² (>0.8 target), MAE (<20% of average resolution time), RMSE. If metrics low, iterates (add more TF-IDF features, remove outliers >95th percentile). Saves best model to models/reg_model.pkl. Logs to outputs/model_log.txt.


Clustering (clustering.py): Loads cleaned data, preprocesses (TF-IDF on descriptions + scaled/one-hot features). Finds optimal clusters:

Loops K=2 to 15, computes inertia (elbow plot) and silhouette scores (>0.5 target).
Uses KMeans (n_init=10); fallback to AgglomerativeClustering (hierarchical) or NMF for topic modeling if silhouette low.
Assigns labels, extracts top terms per cluster (from TF-IDF or NMF components). Visualizes with PCA-reduced scatter plot. Saves as data/clustered_tickets.csv. Logs to outputs/cluster_log.txt.


Dashboard (dashboard.py): Interactive Streamlit app launched via streamlit run dashboard.py.

Overview: Project summary and data stats.
KPIs: Metrics like average resolution time, first contact resolution rate (if escalation_history available, else approximate), CSAT (average satisfaction_scores), SLA compliance (% resolved <24 hours).
Trends: Plotly charts (bar for resolution by priority/cluster, line for weekly ticket volume, scatter for resolution vs. description length).
Predict Resolution: Form for new ticket inputs (priority selectbox, category, description text area, department); preprocesses (add features, encode, scale, TF-IDF), predicts using loaded model, displays result.
Cluster Analysis: Table of cluster summaries (mean resolution, count), filterable views, scatter plots.
Additional: File uploader for custom CSV analysis, tabs for organization, error handling for inputs. Logs to outputs/dashboard_log.txt.


Main Orchestration (main.py): Runs all scripts sequentially using subprocess, generates requirements.txt with pinned versions, creates this README.md, and launches the dashboard.
